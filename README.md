Since I am responsible for virtually all data updates to the database for \<plan name>, there can be ~60+ logs each week to process. Some can be closed after the database has been updated, while others (deaths) need to be re-assigned for further processing.

The update process has been more or less sufficiently streamlined allowing for bulk updates done in batches. Manually closing/re-assigning ~60+ logs at once was a hassle though, so I hacked together this script.

It's not the fastest (the site can be glitchy sometimes) but it works error-free and allows me to do other things while it runs in the background. As the saying goes, "Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast".
